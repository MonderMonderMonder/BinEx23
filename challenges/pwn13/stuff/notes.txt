CONCEPT 1:
  use negative number to read too much data
  write to null byte of stack caqrnary of main using ofl (this will only be checked once main returns)
  it is now considered part of the string
  now leak it
  Since parent process lives on, we can now use it when reconnecting
  use same trick to override full carnary with correct value
  use partial override of return address to handle to jump to correct addr (PIE is enabled!)
