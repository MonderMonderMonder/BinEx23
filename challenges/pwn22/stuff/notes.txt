CONCEPT 1:
 - allocate nodes of size:
   0: 0x20, 1: 0x20, 2: 0x90, 3: 0x20, 4: 0x90, 5: 0x20
 - free nodes 2 and 4
 - write to note 0 and override size of node 1 so that next node by size is node 3
 - free node 1 -> free chunk now includes node 2
 - allocate node to freed chunk
 - dump content of new node -> leaks heap and libc from fd/bw pointers of node 2
 - ...continue with leaked info
